<p><i><font size="5"><b>Ambade, or Indian hog plums,</b> 
are best-known for the sour tinge they add to prawn curry, 
besides their inner inedible fibrous part, making for an enjoyable
chewing experience during the meal. While this smaller sour variety
of ambade are found during the winter months, the larger ones, known as 
<b>godd ambade, </b>are available earlier in the year — during the latter 
half of the monsoons.As the name suggests, godd ambade have only a hint of 
the sourness its better known <b>relative carries.</b> And if one still feels like
relishing ambyachem sansanv after the mango season is over, the sweet-sour godd
ambade make for perfect replacement.
