<p><i><font size="5"><B>DHOKLA</B> Dhokla is a vegetarian culinary dish that is native to the Indian state of Gujarat and parts of 
adjacent states. It is also commonly served in other parts of India. It is made with a fermented batter derived from legumes like 
Chickpea, Pigeon pea and Urad and rice. Dhokla can be eaten for breakfast, as a main course, as a side dish, or as a snack. 
Dhokla is very similar to Khaman, however Khaman is typically made from Chickpeas gram and looks yellow in color. Khaman has become 
widely popular outside Gujarat but is misunderstood or incorrectly known as Dhokla.
