<p><i><font size="5">These are scrumptious but very oily <b>banana fritters or bhajjis.
</b> This is made from the delicious <b>Nenthra pazham abundant</b> in coastal 
Kerala and Karnataka. A banana fritter is a fritter made by deep frying battered banana 
or plantain in hot oil. It is a common dish across Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. 
<b>Banana fritters</b> are a traditional snack in Brunei, where they are called <b>cucur pisang.
</b> They are similar to pisang goreng in Indonesia and Malaysia. Cucur pisang madu, a variant
of cucur pisang made with honey, are popular as a light afternoon meal. Banana Fritters are made 
with cakey batter, fried to perfection and loaded with bananas. In a medium bowl, whisk together
 the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside. In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, milk, 
vanilla, and melted butter.
