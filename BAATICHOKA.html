<p><i><font size="5"><B>BAATI CHOKA</B>Baati Chokha, a favourite delicacy in Bihar makes for a tasty street snack in Varanasi too. 
Stuffed whole wheat dough balls are stuffed with roasted chana dal and spices inside. These stuffed balls are known as Litties and are 
roasted over charcoal. 
Litti, along with chokha, is a complete meal originated from the Indian state of Bihar and parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh.
It is a dough ball made up of whole wheat flour and stuffed with gram flour, pulses and mixed with herbs and spices and then baked over coal 
or wood then it is tossed with much ghee. Although very often confused with the closely related baati, it is a completely different dish 
in terms of taste, texture and preparation. It may be eaten with yogurt, baigan chokha, alu chokha, and papad. The litti are traditionally 
baked over wood fire,but in the modern day a new fried version has been developed.
Herbs and spices used to flavour the litti include onion, garlic, ginger, coriander leaves, lime juice, carom seeds, nigella seeds and salt. 
Tasty pickles can also be used to add spice flavour. In western Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh litti is served with murgh korma 
(a creamy chicken curry) or chokha (a vegetable preparation of roasted and mashed eggplant, tomato, and potato)
