<p><i><font size="5"><B>CHAAT</B>Chaat is among the most ubiquitous items among the street food of the entire country.
Allahabad takes pride in its mouth-watering street food and the chaat is just to die for. However, as any Allahabadi will tell you,
 no one makes it like Nirala ki Chaat. The shop has been making their chaat delicacies for years together and has since become an 
identifying feature of the Loknath Lane. The best part, however, is that all the items on their menu such as 'Dahi-Sonth ke Batashe', 
Papdi Chaat, and Phulkis are made from Desi Ghee. This, according to the locals, is what makes all the difference. For a true gastronomic 
delight, indulging in Allahabadi chaat is a must.
