Bihar occupied an important position in the early history of India. For centuries it was the principal seat of imperial
 powers and the main focus of Indian culture and civilization. The derivation of the name Bihar from the Sanskrit vihara
(Buddhist monastery) reflects the prominence of such communities in the region in ancient times.
