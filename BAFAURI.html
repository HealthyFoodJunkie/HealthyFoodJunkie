<p><i><font size="5"><B>BAFAURI</B>Bafuari is a healthy alternative for the oily pakodas which are every Indianâ€™s favourite snack. 
Bafauri is a famous dish of the state which is cooked in Chana Daal flour. Various vegetables and spices add the mouth-savoring taste to 
the dish. The dough is prepared in the form of balls and is steamed. The fact that is not cooked in oil makes it extremely healthy to eat.
