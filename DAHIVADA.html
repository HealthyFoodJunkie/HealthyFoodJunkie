<p><i><font size="5"><B>DAHI WADA ALOO DUM</B>Yet another popular street food that we see after gupchup in Odisha, 
is Dahi vada and Aloo dum. Go out at even 5 in the morning and you can see thela walas with their big pots of dahi vada 
and smaller pots filled with aloo dum. While everywhere else, dahi vada and aloo dum are considered to be two separate dishes, 
Odisha offers a distinctive blend of the both. The relishing taste of dahi vadas carefully neutralises the spiciness of aloo dum, 
giving the taste that every Odia craves for. Also famous as the 'Vada Pav' of Cuttack, 
this dish has surely paved its way into people's hearts and everyday lives.
