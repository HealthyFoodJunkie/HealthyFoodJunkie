<P><i><font size="5">Though chaat is a popular item available throughout the country, the ‘Patna Chaat’ is known for its unique taste and essence. It is renowned for its drool worthy tamarind flavour , unlike the sweet and salty ones in rest of the cities. Tikki Chaat, Samosa Chaat and Papri Chaat are at their crunchiest best and are available in almost all the restaurants, college canteens and road side stalls. Tikki Chaat from Exhibition Road and Papri Chaat from Ashok Rajpath, Bangali dada are a must try in Patna.
