<p><i><font size="5"><B>CHHOLE SAMOSE</B> no food pilgrimage in Allahabad can ever be complete without a trip to Sainik's in Ashok Nagar 
that sells the most flavorful and amazing Chhole Samose at Sainik Sweets. The traditional potato-filled samosa is crushed and the spicy chhole 
are added over it along with curds, some tamarind Chatni,  onions, coriander and sev to make this legendary street food of Allahabad. 
It can be had a snack or even as a meal by itself. Don't try to pack it home though, the real taste of it lies in the hot steaming samosas 
and fresh chutneys.
