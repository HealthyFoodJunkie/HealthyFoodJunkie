<p><u><font size="9"><h1 align="center">CHICKEN ANARDANA</h1></font></u></p>
<p><i><font size="5">This is a deceptive <b>chicken</b> recipe, as by its appearance you
have flames of tangy, spicy, warm flavor increasing in your head.
It might scare you and look heavy for a weak stomach or too oily.
But in reality it’s just the <b>ground anardana</b> (dry pomegranate seeds) playing their part.
They add the <b>tang</b> to the dish, which you will certainly really feel 
after a couple of mouthfuls. The special flavors include in the <b>smokiness</b> of the flavor.
It is served with <b>paranthas</b> or <b>triangle flatbreads</b>.
