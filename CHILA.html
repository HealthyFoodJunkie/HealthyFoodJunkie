<p><i><font size="5"><B>CHILA</B> What we all enjoy eating in all the parts of India is a gift from the Chhattisgarh region. Chila is flat 
chapati like dish which is prepared with the rice batter mixed with the Urad Daal. The dish is very easy to cook and is very delicious 
in the taste. Chila is an important part of the breakfast meal of the people of Chhattisgarh. To grab the best taste of Chila, complement 
it with the green chutney.
