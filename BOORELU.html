<p><i><font size="5"><b>Boorelu</b> will find this dish at every local
house in the city during any Telugu festivities. They are simply
dumplings made with <b>rice flour</b> and stuffed with fresh <b>coconut
shavings</b>. <b>Chana dal</b> is also mixed with the coconut to set it
in place and to add more flavour to the dish.
