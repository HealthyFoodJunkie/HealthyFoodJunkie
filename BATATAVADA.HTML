<p><i><font size="5">Whether it's for breakfast, teatime, or anytime, one thing is for sure, Mumbaikars can't live without the <B>batatavada</B> bite. This well-liked fast food dumpling is made by mashing boiled potatoes with green chilies, ginger, garlic, lime juice, turmeric, and fresh coriander, which is then dipped in a besan (gram flour) batter and deep fried. It's served either with a <B>green chutney </B>or fried green chillies.
