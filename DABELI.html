<p><i><font size="5"><b>Dabeli</b> is quite a hit among foodies in <b>Udaipur</b>. 
It is like <b>'desi'</b> burger wherein the bun is stuffed with boiled potatoes
that have been garnished with roasted peanuts, pomegranate and chutneys.
There are various street vendors in the city that sell <b>dabeli</b>, but none like the
small stall near the popular <b>Sukhadia Circle</b>. The tiny stall named <b>Shankar</b> near
Happinezz (ice cream parlour) is ‘the place’ to have this street food. It is 
somewhat similar to vada pav (which is also served here) but with slight 
sweetness and garnish (peanuts and pomegranate). Also, the vendor crisps
up the <b>dabeli</b> with dollops of butter and serves it hot with a smile.
