<p><i><font size="5"><B>BASKET CHAAT</B> is a family of savoury snacks that originated in India, typically served as an hors 
d'oeuvre or at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts across South Asia in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. With its origins in Uttar 
Pradesh, India,chaat has become immensely popular in the rest of South Asia and the Caribbean.
For someone who is a fan of street food and chaat, it is something that you must not miss when in Lucknow. Also known as tokri or katori chaat, 
this dish is truly delicious with flavours that will burst in your mouth in a single bite. Made of grated potatoes, the basket is deep-fried 
and then filled with matar, tikki chutneys with a garnishing of pomegranate, sev and aromatic spices. Hazratganj, Royal Caf√© serves the best 
Basket Chaat in Lucknow.
