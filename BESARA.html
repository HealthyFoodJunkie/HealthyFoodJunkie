<p><i><font size="5"><B>BESARA</B>Odisha, Shree Jagannath Temple. All three play a major role in the choice of recipe for this post. 
Further, this is the title of the section of the book 'Bhagwaan Ke Pakwaan', that set me on the path to making this really tasty curry, 
an authentic and traditional Odia Vegetable Besara: mixed vegetables cooked in Orissa cuisine's trademark mustard paste.
This simple aesthetic dish is a mixture of potato, pumpkin, banana and papaya.
 The mustard seeds, cumin seeds, garlic and dry chilli, make it flavoury to the authentic taste of Odiya. 
Cut vegetables and sliced onions that turn golden brown as you fry them in the pan makes your little heart yearn to savour it. 
The dish garnished with coriander leaves is a cherry on top.
