Daal Pithi is a super healthy recipe made of wheat dumplings boiled in red lentil soup. We hardly need 1 teaspoon of oil while tempering. Because of its soup like consistency, it is even loved by the toddlers. This recipe is perfect to eat for the expecting mother's who find it difficult to eat during their first semesters. As it has both wheat and red lentils, it forms a complete meal.</P>
