<p><i><font size="5">This delectable curry is made chiefly out of two ingredients, namely <B>potatoes and green peas</B>. A few other added spices like cumin powder, ginger paste, chilli powder give this dish a mild flavour, which is both <B>tangy and sour</B> in the right amounts. It makes a great side dish with uncountable number of breads and rotis, rice and other foods.
