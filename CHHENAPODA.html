<p><i><font size="5"><B>GUPCHUP</B>The Traditional Food of Odisha.
Odisha's very own cheesecake! The one sweet that Odisha is famous for - Chhena Poda, also known to be Lord Jagannath's favourite sweet 
and is often offered to him at the Puri Temple. The lingering taste of burnt home-made cottage cheese and semolina combined with sugar 
syrup simply blow away your mind. This rare dessert is baked for several hours until it becomes red and the caramelised sugar brings out
S the distinct flavour of Chhena Poda. Being sold in almost every nook and corner, this dish is simple, easy and absolutely delicious.
