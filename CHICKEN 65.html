<p><i><font size="5">If there is one dish that is ubiquitous in India,
mastered by roadside stalls and big restaurants alike, it is <b>Chilli Chicken</b>. 
A spicier version of this Chicken Chilli (with a decidedly South Indian twist
of curry leaves and dried Kashmiri chilli), <b>Chicken 65</b> is a favourite of the locals here.
In <b>Vijayawada</b> and other parts of <b>Andhra Pradesh</b>, you’ll find Chicken 65 being
sold at many local eateries and Chinese food stalls. It’s also a popular <b>starter</b>
that is served at drinking joints, from mediocre bars to five-stars.
