<p><i><font size="5"><B>CholeBhature</B> is a special dish from <B>Bhatinda.</B> People prepare the Cholesabji adding all the required masalas. Chole is a great combination with Bhature. Bhature is similar to Puri but it’s bigger in size than the Puri. It is tasty to eat. They make it from Maida i.e. the all-purpose Flour, unlike the Puri which they prepare from Wheat Flour.
