<p><i><font size="5"><B>DALMA</B> Aah Dalma! You just can't get enough of dal, can you? However, 
this staple food comes with a unique twist when in Odisha. It is made with roasted moong dal without any onion or garlic.
 A few regular spices along with a cup of veggies are added to it to give it a lip-smacking flavour. Common veggies include pumpkin, 
plantain, yam and papaya, which work like magic on your overall health. Mostly eaten with rice, this finger-licking meal will more
 than satiate your appetite.
