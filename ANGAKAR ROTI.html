<p><i><font size="5"><b>Angakar Roti</b> is a breakfast dish made in <b>Bilarpur</b>, using
the <b>staple flour</b> of the region. The simplest version of this flatbread is made 
with just rice flour along with spices. Rice flour Roti tastes delicious with a spice side dish.
When we had done the Indian Food Odyssey, where we cooked alphabetically from 
each Indian State, I had chosen to make Chusela, which is a popular rice pooris from
<b>Bilarpur</b>, and had also mentioned the <b>Rice Roti</b> that's popularly known as the 
<b>Angakar Roti</b>, made with <b>rice flour</b>.
