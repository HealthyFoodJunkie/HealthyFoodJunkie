<p><i><font size="5"><B>DAAL BAFLA</B> is an Indian dish of daal (lentils) and baati (hard wheat rolls). It is popular in 
Madhya Pradesh (especially in Braj, Nimar and Malwa regions), Rajasthan, Maharashtra’s Khandesh and Vidarbha region, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.
Daal is prepared using tuvaar dal, chana daal (prepared by removing skin of split chickpeas), mung dal, moth dal, or urad dal. The pulses or 
lentils are cooked together after being soaked in water for a few hours. First, a small amount of vegetable oil is heated in a frying pan and 
then the seasoning rai-jeera (mustard and cumin seeds) is added into the hot oil. Then green chilli, garlic and some spices including 
asafoetida, red chilli, turmeric, coriander, ginger are added. There may be a sweet and sour version of dal in some regions. Finally, the 
boiled daal is added and cooked.
bafla is a hard bread made up of wheat flour commonly known as aata. Wheat flour is kneaded with little bit of salt, dahi (yogurt) and water. Tennis ball-sized round balls of this dough are cooked in a well-heated traditional oven or in an earthen stove. When the Baati becomes golden brown in colour, it is greased with ghee and is then served with daal, rava laddoo, rice, pudina chutney, kairi (raw mango) chutney, garlic chutney, green salad with much onion, and fresh buttermilk.
