<p><i><font size="5">A traditional namkeen, <b>Dalmoth</b> is a savoury dry snack 
that is a famous food of <b>Agra</b>. It is <b>crispy, spicy</b> and is made with <b>lentils, nuts</b> and <b>spices</b>. 
This snack is unique, and it is likely that you probably never had something like this before.
This all time snack is a perfect accompaniment to a <b>warm tea</b>, a <b>cool sherbet</b> and even a 
<b>chilled beer</b>. Available all over Agra, our recommendation, however, is buying 
it at one of the original stores of Panchi Petha.
