<p><i><font size="5"><B>CHOORA MATAR</B> is made differently in both UP and bihar. In UP the making of chura matar resembles the 
preparation of Maharashtrian kanda poha, whereas in bihar the poha is fried and is somewhat like a poha chiwda.
The taste of chura matar is very different from Poha recipe (onion poha) or Batata poha (potato poha). Ingredients like black pepper powder, 
garam masala powder and asafoetida (hing) are added which makes this dish taste very different than Maharashtrian kanda poha. Also no onions 
are added. So this recipe is a no onion no garlic version of peas poha. Few more variations of poha which you may like are:
Kanda batata poha (with both onions and potatoes).
Poha upma (made with mix vegetables)
