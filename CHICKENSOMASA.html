<p><i><font size="5"><B>CHICKEN SOMASA</B> is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as 
spiced potatoes, onions, peas. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.
Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Samosas are a popular entr√©e, 
appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their diasporas.
Chicken Samosa is a non-vegetarian fried snack that has great demand in Jabalpur region. A flour shell is filled with spices and 
chicken meat stuffing. The preparation is then deep fried until brown and hard and is eaten with chutneys. Sometimes it is enjoyed 
after being mashed and extra liquid masala is added on top.
