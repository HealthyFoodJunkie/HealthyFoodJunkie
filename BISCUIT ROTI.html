 & delicious. Biscuit roti are a popular Udupi, Mangalore snack. They are spicy and sweet. Crispy 
biscuit roti are usually served as a tea time snack.Biscuit roti are puffed up puris of plain flour
 (maida) with a layer of seasoned semolina filling. Biscuit roti are similar to the kachoris of North
 India.Biscuit rotis stay crispy until the next day. They then get soft but continue to taste delicious.
 They can be stored for 2-5 days.You can make a batch of these puris & store them to enjoy them 
any time of the day. That way you don’t have to wait for evening tea to enjoy these biscuit rotis.
Unlike other puri’s, where you’ll have to make fresh ones when people turn up.This snack hardly 
takes any time to prepare, hardly any effort and skill. You can also make them quickly when guests
 drop in unannounced.
