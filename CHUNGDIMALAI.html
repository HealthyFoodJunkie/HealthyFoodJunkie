<p><i><font size="5"><B>CHUNGDI MALAI</B> Well, as the name suggests, this dish is all about the delicious creamy prawn curry,
where the creamy part comes from the coconut milk. 
The richness and silkiness of this fantastic dish are further enriched by light and mild spices
that add a unique character to it. Absolutely delightful, mouth-watering and flavoursome! Best served with
steamed basmati rice, this delicacy is a must try if you are in and around Odisha.
