<p><i><font size="5"><B>BORE BASSI</B> Bore Baasi refers to cooked fermented rice, a cooling and comforting rice preparation consumed in 
summer months in eastern states. It is often considered as poor man’s food, as it is mostly consumed by labourers and farmers. 
On Labour Day, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel appealed to the citizens via a video message to consume 'Bore Baasi' mentioning 
that it is good for health. As per a TOI report, in the video message he said that this food is the support system for hardworking labourers 
and in order to acknowledge their efforts, let's eat what they relish. According to his video message, labourers and farmers eat Bore Baasi 
for lunch or before leaving home for work in Chhattisgarh and we should pay respect to them on labourers' day by consuming Bore Baasi.
