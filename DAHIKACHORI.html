<p><i><font size="5"><B>DAHI KACHORI</B> Dahi kachori is a favorite roadside snack of the Indian subcontinent. Kachori is a type of 
spicy snack that is eaten wherever the Indian diaspora is and throughout Southern Asia. Kachori is very similar to a fritter, in that 
it is most similar to a stuffed fritter. Typically, kachori is stuffed with dal besan, red chili powder, black pepper, salt, and other spices. 
The dahi kachori is stuffed with dahi which is a type of curd and chutney. It’s perfect for enjoying with a beer on a hot day.
One of the best things about dahi kachori is that it is made using whole wheat flour. Believe it or not, this is becoming a rarity in the 21st 
century where there are a lot of mechanisms in place to encourage you to utilize processed flour. This is unfortunate because whole wheat flour 
is infinitely healthier for you than processed flour. Some of its health benefits include:
• Reduces risk of heart disease
• Reduces risk of stroke
• Reduces risk of obesity
• Supports healthy digestion
